description: 'Yoga is an ancient form of training the mind to focus, bringing it into a calm and clear state. In Iyengar Yoga, the body and the breathe are used as the focal points. Joints are aligned within each posture (asana) to prevent injury, and muscles are engaged to create strength as well as flexibility.'
