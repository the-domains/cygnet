description: '"THANK YOU so much for organising Handmade in Cygnet. We, four of us, have just finished 5 hours on this trail. WOW! We were so impressed with everything we saw, and made many purchases...but, unfortunately, we only managed 7 out of 31. I guess, that was due to talking too much to the artist/craft people.'
